A lumpy and dummy JavaScript module bundler for those who are stuck in the past

![Lumpy logo](/resources/lumpy-logo.png)


## üíΩ Install

As usual in 2018, most of the software is installed through `npm`, this one makes no difference:

```bash
npm install --global lumpy
```

Be sure to have `node >= 8.0.0`.

At this point you should be able to run the `lumpy` executable. Try it with:

```bash
lumpy --help
```


### üíæ Precompiled binaries

Alternatively, you can install lumpy by downloading one of the precompiled executables available for Windows, Linux or Mac in the [releases page](https://github.com/lmammino/lumpy/releases).


## ü¶î Usage

Lumpy helps you to build a JavaScript bundle file for your frontend applications dependencies starting from a lumpy file (`lumpy.txt`).

A lumpy file is a plain text file that contains a list of the URLS of all your dependencies. An example `lumpy.txt` looks as follows:

```plain
# lumpy.txt
https://unpkg.com/zepto@1.2.0/dist/zepto.min.js
https://unpkg.com/uuidjs@4.0.3/dist/uuid.core.js
https://unpkg.com/store2@2.7.0/dist/store2.min.js
https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@2.2.3/dist/tippy.all.min.js
https://unpkg.com/confetti-js@0.0.11/dist/index.min.js
https://unpkg.com/dom-confetti@0.0.10/lib/main.js
https://unpkg.com/favico.js@0.3.10/favico-0.3.10.min.js
```

A lumpy file can contain only URLs and comments. A comments is a line starting with `#`. Separate URLs need to be in separate lines. You can have as many empty lines as you want.

Inside your project, once you create your `lumpy.txt` file, listing all the dependencies for your frontend application, you can create a single compiled file containing all of them with the following command:

```bash
lumpy build
```

This will output the built package in `vendor.js`. This file will contain the code contained in all the URLs specified in your `lumpy.txt` file (in the same order). By default the resulting JavaScript file will be minified using [babel-minify](http://npm.im/babel-minify).


## üò± Advanced usage

The `lumpy` executable offers 3 main sub-commands:

  - `build`: creates a build package from a `lumpy.txt` file
  - `clear-cache`: clears the cache folder
  - `--help`: display the help for the main executable or a subcommand (`lumpy [build | clear-cache] --help`)


### üì¶ Build

The build command allows you to build a vendors package from a `lumpy.txt` file.

#### Usage:

```bash
lumpy build [destFile]
```

Where `destFile` is the path of the *compiled* bundle file (by default it will be `vendors.js` in the current working directory).

#### Options:

  - `--lumpyFile, -l [file]`: (optional) the lumpy file to use. By default it will check for a `lumpy.txt` file in the current working directory
  - `--cacheFolder, -c [path]`: (optional) the path to a folder where the cache files are stored. By default it will create a `.lumpy-cache` directory in your user home directory.
  - `--noMinify, -M`: (optional) if set it won't minify the resulting vendors bundle file.
  - `--noCache, -C`: (optional) if set it won't try to use the cache
  - `--stdout, -o`: (optional) if set it will output the resulting bundle in the standard output instead of a doing that on a file. Useful if you want to pipe the resulting content to another command.


### üõÄüèø Clear cache

Clear the cache folder deleting all the previously downloaded files.

#### Usage:

```bash
lumpy clear-cache
```

#### Options:

- `--cacheFolder, -c [path]`: (optional) the path to a folder where the cache files are stored. By default it will create a `.lumpy-cache` directory in your user home directory.
